## Question 1

- Unit test: Testing units of code which are just small chunks of related code
- Integration test: Testing units with other units to see if they work well
- Regresstion test: Re-running old tests to make sure that the new fixes you've made don't bring back any bugs

## Question 2

PyTest discovery is the way that PyTest finds and runs the code. It looks for file and function names that are formatted in a specific way and tests those. File and function names need to start or end with "test\_" or "\_test" to be checked by PyTest. A fixture is a piece of code that can be used for the test functions.

## PyTest Features Used
